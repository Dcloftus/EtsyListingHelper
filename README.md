# Etsy Listing Helper
Created a small tool to help he list digital artwork on etsy.

This program takes in a file path to some digital artwork and a set of true or false params to determine with actions to take.

This program can:
1. Duplicate, resize, and crop the source image
2. Create a cover image with the source image overlayed in a mockup for Etsy and an Instagram post
3. Add all image varients to personal drop box and gather a shared link to the folder
4. Create a download guide PDF with a link to the Drop Box folder
5. Use Chat GPT to describe the source image and write:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Etsy Tags to use
   - Etsy Secitons to put it in
   - Instagram Post Description
   - Instagram Hash Tags
